### üö´ What NOT to Do

- **Do not** exploit vulnerabilities on mainnet
- **Do not** access, modify, or delete data that is not yours
- **Do not** perform actions that could negatively affect users
- **Do not** publicly disclose the vulnerability until we've had time to address it
- **Do not** demand payment or threaten public disclosure

## üéØ Bug Bounty Program

### Scope and Rewards

| Severity | Impact | Reward Range |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| **Critical** | Loss of funds, contract takeover | $5,000 - $25,000 |
| **High** | Unauthorized access, data exposure | $1,000 - $5,000 |
| **Medium** | Denial of service, logic errors | $500 - $1,000 |
| **Low** | Information disclosure, minor issues | $100 - $500 |

### Eligibility Criteria
- **First reporter** of a previously unknown vulnerability
- **Constructive report** with clear documentation
- **Responsible disclosure** following our guidelines
- **No violation** of our terms of service or applicable laws

### Out of Scope
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks on infrastructure
- Denial of service attacks
- Issues in third-party services (unless directly affecting our platform)
- Known issues already documented or being addressed

## üîê Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security

#### Access Controls
- **Multi-signature wallets** for critical administrative functions
- **Role-based permissions** with principle of least privilege
- **Timelock mechanisms** for sensitive operations
- **Emergency pause functionality** for critical situations

#### Code Quality
- **Comprehensive testing** with >95% coverage
- **Static analysis** using tools like Slither, Mythril
- **Formal verification** for critical functions
- **Third-party audits** before mainnet deployment

#### Oracle Security
- **Multiple data sources** to prevent single points of failure
- **Price deviation checks** to detect manipulation
- **Staleness detection** to ensure data freshness
- **Circuit breakers** for extreme market conditions

### Infrastructure Security

#### Network Security
- **DDoS protection** on all public endpoints
- **Web application firewall** (WAF)
- **SSL/TLS encryption** for all communications
- **VPN access** for administrative functions

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption at rest** for sensitive data
- **Encryption in transit** for all communications
- **Regular backups** with tested recovery procedures
- **Access logging** and monitoring

#### Monitoring and Alerting
- **24/7 monitoring** of smart contracts and infrastructure
- **Automated alerts** for unusual activities
- **Real-time dashboards** for system health
- **Incident response procedures** for security events

## üöÄ Response Process

### Initial Response (0-24 hours)
1. **Acknowledge receipt** of the security report
2. **Assign severity level** based on impact assessment
3. **Assemble response team** with relevant expertise
4. **Begin initial investigation** and impact analysis

### Investigation Phase (1-7 days)
1. **Reproduce the vulnerability** in a safe environment
2. **Assess full impact** and potential attack vectors
3. **Develop remediation plan** with timelines
4. **Prepare patches or updates** as needed

### Resolution Phase (1-30 days)
1. **Deploy fixes** to affected systems
2. **Verify resolution** through testing
3. **Monitor for any side effects** or additional issues
4. **Communicate with reporter** on resolution status

### Post-Resolution (30+ days)
1. **Conduct post-mortem** analysis
2. **Update security measures** to prevent similar issues
3. **Public disclosure** (coordinated with reporter)
4. **Process bug bounty payment** if applicable
